üë• HR Analytics Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI Project
üìå Project Overview
This project features an interactive HR analytics dashboard built using Power BI. The goal was to help HR departments gain better insights into employee attrition, demographics, and job satisfaction patterns to support data-driven workforce decisions.

üéØ Problem Statement
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations, and often the underlying reasons are not clearly understood. This dashboard aims to bridge that gap by highlighting patterns based on department, age, gender, job role, and education. It empowers HR managers to identify key problem areas, enabling proactive interventions for improving employee retention and satisfaction.

üõ†Ô∏è Steps Followed
Data Loading: The raw HR dataset was imported into Power BI Desktop from a spreadsheet.
Data Cleaning: Fields were renamed for clarity, data types were corrected, and empty or irrelevant columns were removed.
Modeling: Relationships were set between key fields to ensure accurate filtering and slicing across visuals.
Calculated Fields: New age group categories were created to segment the workforce into meaningful brackets. Key metrics such as attrition rate, average age, and total employee count were also derived.
Visual Design:
Donut charts were used to show attrition percentage by department and gender.
Bar charts displayed attrition by job role and education field.
Matrix visuals presented job satisfaction levels across different job roles.
KPI cards showed total employees, attrition rate, and average age.
Slicers allowed dynamic filtering based on department, gender, age group, and education.
User Experience: A clean layout with consistent color themes was applied. The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to drill down into data for specific segments and perform comparative analysis.
Publishing: The completed dashboard was published to Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.

üìä Key Insights
Attrition Analysis: Some departments and job roles exhibited notably higher attrition, offering areas of focus for retention efforts.
Demographic Breakdown: Most of the workforce fell in the 26‚Äì35 age group. However, the younger age bracket (‚â§25) showed a relatively higher attrition rate.
Satisfaction Matrix: Job satisfaction varied noticeably across roles, indicating potential links between role type and employee sentiment.
Education Insights: Education fields showed patterns in role compatibility and retention, offering opportunities for better talent-role alignment.
